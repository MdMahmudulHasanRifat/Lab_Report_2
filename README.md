# 📘 KNN from Scratch: Flower and News Classification with Custom Evaluation Metrics

This project demonstrates a full implementation of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm from scratch using Python. It also includes custom evaluation metrics: **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**—all built manually without relying on libraries like `scikit-learn` (except for dataset loading and comparison).

## ✅ Features

- ✅ KNN classification without using machine learning libraries
- ✅ Custom implementations of:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
- ✅ Tested on:
  - 🌸 **Iris Dataset**
  - 📰 **News Dataset** *(optional, text data with TF-IDF)*
- ✅ Comparison with scikit-learn’s `KNeighborsClassifier`
